One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is question-answering(Q/A) chatbots. These are applications can answer questions based on specific source information.

Here I try to build a simple Q/A application over a text data source which is a web blog post using Retrieval Augmented Generation or simply RAG. I also used Langchain which provides the core building blocks to structure, run, and scale LLM-powered applications.
